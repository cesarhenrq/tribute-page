        Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) was a German mathematician who made
        significant contributions to many fields, including number theory,
        algebra, statistics, analysis, differential geometry, geophysics,
        electrostatics, astronomy, and optics. Sometimes referred to as the
        Princeps mathematicorum (Latin for "the foremost of mathematicians") and
        "greatest mathematician since antiquity", Gauss had an exceptional
        influence in many fields of mathematics and science and is ranked as one
        of history's most influential mathematicians.
